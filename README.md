# NSS Mastery | Jungle Kingdom

## Game Features

Game uses ES6 language features such as **let**, **const**, fat arrows, property shorthand, method properties, and string templates. jQuery is the preferred syntax and is used for interacting with the DOM.

## Game Functionality

1. When the user interface first loads, there are 2 text inputs to name the two animals that will do battle.
